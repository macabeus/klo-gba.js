**klo-gba.js** is a web Level Editor for *Klonoa: Empire of Dreams* game. Using this tool, you can extend the limits of this awesome game! Please, buy Klonoa's games to support this franchise.

Since this is a study project, I'm writing a manual about how I'm developing it, because I want that more people to learn how to do a rom hacking for others games. It's a very fun challenge!

## Architecture of this project

klo-gba.js is a monorepo built with two projects: `üñå brush` and `‚úÇÔ∏è scissors`. Both projects are written using JS, will be compiled by Babel and uses Webpack.

### Brush

It is responsible to provide a web interface for the user to upload the ROM of Klonoa's game and to view/edit the levels.

This project uses the React component library [Former-Kit](https://github.com/pagarme/former-kit) and it uses Scissors as a dependencie.

### Scissors

It is reponsible to provide informations about each level. To do it so Scissors extracts the informations from a buffer of the ROM and also has some hardcoded informations about each level.
